<h1 align="center" id="title">Portfolio Website</h1>

<p id="description">This project is my portfolio. The main idea was to create a web site that would contain basic information about me, my technology stack, education and projects.
    
  One of the main features are beautiful, smooth animations of appearances, transitions, scrolling across the page. They are realized with the help of Framer-motion.
